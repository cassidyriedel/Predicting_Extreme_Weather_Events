This project analyzes a multi-country climate dataset (2000–2023) to explore relationships between temperature, emissions, rainfall, sea level rise, renewable energy usage, and extreme weather. Using machine learning, I build a Random Forest classifier to predict whether a country experiences a high number of extreme weather events based on environmental and economic indicators in a certain year.
